rights
unfortunately by my rough ___ he used better than N words <unk> <unk> on the witnesses for exercising the fifth
guess
he <unk> his ___ of constitutional meat between large <unk> of <unk> commentary

as your editorial ___ pointed out samuel <unk> former hud secretary and <unk> wilson mr. <unk> 's former aide are currently being held up to <unk> for taking the fifth amendment

that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by mr. ___
<unk>
N that his committee does not deal with any possible ___ activity at hud
criminal
my colleagues and i ___ realize we are not a court etc
fully
___ <unk>
<unk>
by any reasonable man <unk> mr. <unk> and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and ___
convicted
apparently their ___ is in
verdict
___ now they 're pursuing evidence
right
that 's not a bad way to proceed just somewhat different from standard ___ practice
american
how was that practice ___ to when i was in school
referred
<unk> ___ something called a star chamber
yes
of course mr. ___ <unk> protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change

no doubt that 's partially ___
true
everything that mr. <unk> says in his letter is partially ___
true
he ___ right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior hud officials
's
but if his explanation of <unk> is true why is his investigation so ___ as to identify criminal activity
<unk>
why not simply questions ___ to identify sources and causes of waste and <unk>
designed
such as what happened when ___ wanted to know about $ N toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost
congress
no mr. <unk> 's complaints ___ wo n't wash
simply
___ that the journal <unk> the <unk> fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public that took place while mr. <unk> was secretary of hud etc. and so forth
N
no to my mind the journal did not defend ___ fraud waste <unk> <unk> and abuse of the public trust
<unk>
it ___ appropriate constitutional <unk> and practical common sense
defended
the problem which the journal so <unk> pointed out in a number of articles is not the likes of ___ <unk> who after all is really a bit player on the stage but the attempt by congress to enhance itself into a <unk> body
mr.
of course we ___ also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective
've
the system is the ___ not an individual member
problem
individuals can always have their hands ___
<unk>
it 's when such <unk> does n't occur that we 've ___ trouble
got
i do not by any means defend hud ___
management
but i think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a ___ greater danger to american <unk> of liberty and freedom than any <unk> and yes maybe <unk> within hud could possibly generate
far
the last time i saw a similar congressional hearing was when <unk> <unk> joe ___ did his work
<unk>
raymond ___
<unk>
___ n.j
<unk>
i disagree with the statement by ___ <unk> that one should not draw an adverse <unk> against former hud officials who <unk> their fifth amendment privilege against <unk> in congressional hearings
mr.
the fifth amendment states in relevant part that no person shall be <unk> in any ___ case to be a witness against himself
criminal
this privilege against ___ <unk> the drawing of an adverse <unk> against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
<unk>
thus in a criminal case a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's ___ to testify nor can the defendant be <unk> to take the stand as a witness thus forcing him to take the fifth
failure
the privilege however has been limited in <unk> with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal ___ only
matters
the supreme ___ and some states have specifically recognized that the fifth amendment does not preclude the <unk> where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause
court
<unk> v. <unk> ___ u.s. N N
N
thus in a civil case a defendant may be called as a witness he may be forced to testify or take the fifth and his taking of the fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse ___ against him in the civil matter
<unk>
he may take the fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and <unk> belief that his testimony may subject him to ___ prosecution
criminal
allowing the defendant to ___ the fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony <unk> him in the civil matter but because the testimony in the civil matter could be <unk> used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
take
<unk> the risk of such prosecution a court may ___ the defendant to testify
order
thus when mr. <unk> asserted the fifth in a <unk> proceeding particularly after presumably ___ extensive advice from legal counsel one must conclude that he held a <unk> <unk> belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
receiving
the subcommittee congress and the american public have every right to draw the adverse <unk> and to ___ with mr. <unk> 's own belief that his testimony could help <unk> him of a crime
<unk>
drawing the adverse <unk> in a <unk> congressional hearing does not <unk> the fifth amendment ___ against <unk>
