The minimum asset coverage ratio that MCG is required to maintain has been lowered from 200 % to 180 % . The minimum consolidated stockholders equity requirement was reduced from $ 642.9 million prior to December 31 , 2008 to $ 500.0 million effective as of and after December 31 , 2008 . The cross-default provisions were modified so that defaults of indebtedness by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries , including Solutions Capital I , L.P. and the special purpose subsidiaries relating to the 2006-1 term securitization and the MCG secured warehouse credit facility , would not constitute defaults under the notes , as long as MCG ( the parent company ) or any other subsidiary that is not a non-recourse financing subsidiary is not liable for the repayment of such indebtedness .

Until such time as the SunTrust revolving line of credit is paid off , which is expected to be in May 2009 , 60 % of the cash net proceeds of any sale of unencumbered assets by the Company will be contractually required to reduce amounts outstanding under the unsecured notes and the revolving line of credit on a pro rata basis , based on then outstanding amounts .
