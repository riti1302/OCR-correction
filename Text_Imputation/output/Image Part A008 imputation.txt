A. Hartley Oscillator

Introductory Information

tt a te . . .
An Oscillator” is eu Glectronid device used to generate an ac signal of desired frequency. The
frequency of the generated signal depends on circuit parameters. Oscillators may generate sinusoidal
or non-sinusoidal waveforms, different frequencies

‘Clrequencie3 from very low to very high and of the different
amplitude.

The positive feedback in a amplifire increases the “closed loop gain” and makes it greater than
“open loop gain”. It results in instability and operates as an Oscillatory Circuit. The Oscillator circuit
consists of two reactive elements namely Ind)gtor (L) and Capacitor (C) connected in parallel with
each other (Fig. £15.1)
