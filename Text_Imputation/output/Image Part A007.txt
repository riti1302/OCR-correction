biased. Since, the transistor T'y is forward  ___ , through the collector heavy current will flow. So
the transistor Ty will be saturated. The collector potential of the transistor  ___  will be nearly zero,
The base of the transistor Ty will be at  ___   ___  since it is connected to the base of T, through
the resistor  ___ ,. The emitter of the transistor T, is also at ground potential. This will make the
transistor T) to cut-off. The collector of the transistor T, is maintained at  ___ . Now the transistor
T) is in cut-off state and Ty is in the conducting state (saturation level).

Now a positive pulse of sufficient  ___  at the  ___  of the transistor T; to make it conducting,
So a collector current will flow through Re, of the transistor T; and the there will be a voltage drop
across it. This negative change in the collector voltage of T; will be coupled through C, to the base of
the transistor  ___ . This will reduce the collector current of the transistor  ___ . So the collector voltage
of T, will rises. This rise in voltage will be coupled to the base of the transistor T, through  ___ ,. So
the collector current of the transistor T, will rise and the collector voltage decreases simultaneously.
This drop of the collector voltage of the transistor T, will be coupled to the base of the transistor T,
driving it to cut-off region. This € ___  will make T, cut-off and T, in conducting state.

The reduction of the collector  ___  T, from  ___  to zero will force the capacitor C, to discharge
through  ___ . Initially the voltage at the base of the transistor  ___  will be — ___ . Since C, continues to

discharge towards + ___ , the voltage at the base of transistor rises exponentially (Fig.  ___ .2 Waveform
 ___ ,) when the base voltage of the transistor T, rise above  ___ ,  ___  starts conducting again. So the
voltage at the collector of transistor  ___  i.e., across  ___ , decreases and consequently the base voltage
of the transistor T, decreases. Therefore the transistor T, will be driven to cut-off. The collector
voltage of the transistor T, will move  ___  + ___ . Capacitor C; therefore starts charging. Now
the transistor  ___  is ON and T, is OFF.  ___  remains OFF  ___  a positive pulse causes the  ___ 
 ___  to change its state.
