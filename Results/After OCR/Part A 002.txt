4.58  ___  Multimedia and Web Technology ( ___ )

Movies on video builds 30 entire  ___ és or pictures every second; the speed with which each frame is
replaced by the ne ___  one makes the images appear to blend smoothly into movement. Computer animatio ___  can
be effective at 12 to 15 fps (or more). Anything less results in a jerky motion, as the eye detects the Changes from
one frame to the ne ___ .

4.3 TYPES OF ANIMATIONS

There are two main types of  ___ é ___  which are used in multimedia applicatio ___ .

» The first type of animation.  ___  animation or linear animation, is the simple movement of objects on the
screen, generally through linear tra ___ lation. Multimedia development environments often provide the
necessary tools to perform this simple animation procedure.

» The original creation of animation.  ___  animation, however, is very technically and artistically involved
as well as time co ___ uming. Three  ___ ¥ ___  objects are created using a mathematical model. Each
object may be shown in various views, giving the user a realistic se ___ e of third dime ___ ion.

Besides  ___  animation and  ___  animation, there are also other special effects techniques in computer
animation such as morphing and warping.

 

Type of animation in which interpolatio ___   ___  specified points on two or more images create a tra ___ it ___ 
effect. It gives the illusion that the first image is changing into the last one.

 

Warping is a related special effect that allows you to manipulate a single image. For example, you could stretch
a facial feature to change a frown into a smile.

4.4 WHAT IS MORPHING?

Morphing is a special technique that  ___ )a smooth, controlled tra ___ formation of one image into another.
The morphing effect is widely used for various tasks ranging from generation of fancy special effects, smoothing
tra ___ itio ___  between video frames to funny warping of faces and mixing parent’s photos for prediction of how
their child will look like as shown in Figure 4.1 (or recreation of past hero image( ___  he photos of his
descendants).

 

Figure 4.1.A Morphing example.

 ___  example of this sort of tra ___ formation is shown in the well-known Black Or White video clip by
Michael Jackson, where the faces of different people change one into another.
