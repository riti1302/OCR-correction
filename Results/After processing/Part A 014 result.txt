Windows Operating System

4.1 INTRODUCTION
What is an operating
system (OS)?

An operating system (OS) is a
group of cimpute programs
that coordinates all the
activities among cimpute

Operating system is a set of programs which manages the
resources like hardware and software of the cimpute, processes
commands, and controls program execution. When we start a cimpute,
the operating system is the first software that is loaded into the memory.

This concept is called bootleg. While booting, the operating system
organizes all hardware and operating program instructions to Co- _ hardware devices. It is the first

In earlier days user had to design the application according to the internal structure of the hardware. Operating
System was needed to enable the user to design the application without concerning the details of the cimpute’s
internal structure. In general the boundary between the hardware and software is transparent to the user.

4.3 FUNCTIONS OF AN OPERATING SYSTEM

At the simplest level, an operating (set) provides Basiec functions/features to users to maintain all the

programs in cimpute system. The Basie¢ Unctions of an operating system are:
1. Booting the cimpute. The process of starting or restarting the cimpute is known as booting.
2. Resource management. Performs Basiec cimpute tasks e.g., managing the various peripheral
devices e.g., mouse, keyboard, printer, etc. For example, most operating systems now are plug and play
which means a device such as a printer will automatically be dé and configured without any user
intervention.
Provides a user interface. When y}{ load an OS into cimpute, it provides us an environment
like command line or graphical user interface (GUI) where we can do our work.
Handles system resources. Handles cimpute memory and sharing of the central processing
unit (CPU) time by various applications or peripheral devices. The operating system ensures that each
application gets the necessary resources it needs in order to maximize the functionality of the overall

system.
