Introductory Information

Ty a Te . . .
An OsCOLlator” is EU Electronic device used to geNEraTe an ac signal of desired frequency. The
frequency of The geNEraTed signal depends on circuit parameTers. OsCOLlators may geNEraTe sinusoidal
or non-sinusoidal wave forms, different frequencies

‘Clarence from very low to very high and of The different
amplitude.

The positive feedback in a amplifier increases The “closed loop gIan” and makes it greaTer Than
“open loop gIan”. It results in instability and operaTes as an OsCOLlatory Circuit. The OsCOLlator circuit
consists of two reactive elements namely Ind)gator (L) and Capacitor (C) conNEcTed in parallel wiTh
each oTher (Fig. £15.1)
